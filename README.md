**Steps on how to create GitHub Page:**  
**1. Push a working index.html file to your GitHub repository**  
**2. Go to the Settings of your repository in GitHub**  
**3. In the Pages section, look for the Build and Deployment tab and click Source and "Deploy from branch"**  
**4. In the branch, choose main**  
**5. Go back to the Code section of your repository and check for your deployed website/page**
**Key takeaways from this exercise:**  
**I think this exercise will be a good starting point for our web programming journey this semester. I also think that 
this will challenge my lack of artistic skills when it comes to designing and color schemes.**
